## Amazon Music


**Amazon Music** is a music streaming application that supports online and offline music. The online music store is operated by **Amazon** that provides unlimited super-fast streaming alongside Ad-free music experience. The application streams at 256kbps bit rate to produce high quality of data. However, the quality of music can be altered based on the user’s preference. Ideally, the running rate and the storage that the application takes to download a file is between 48kbps and 320kbps which makes it faster when compared to other music apps that are prevalent. To add more to it, they offer voice-recognition supported by Alexa that makes the usage of the application more interactive. It has a unique feature that helps the users to keep the phone from shutting down. When the **sleep timer** option is turned on, it allows the user to set time as to when the music should stop thereby preventing the battery from draining.

In addition, it allows the user to like or dislike a song. Based on the observation, it assimilates the user’s listening habits and provides suggestions accordingly. They also offer mood-based playlists that help discover music without having to search manually. The users can create customized playlists that allow them to store their offline music based on their order of preference and share it across multiple devices. Furthermore, it allows the users to clear memory or dump data from the local cache which makes the application utilize the storage space smartly.

The application effectively uses the cloud space sponsored by amazon cloud drive by making the songs available to the users within a fraction of seconds. It also allows the users to play music from their local disk or repository within a seamless touch. Even though the application does not throw any streaming delays, the demands of the echo O
owners create lagging issues/playback problems and sometimes even fail to respond thus causing the music to stop abruptly. To enhance the usability, Amazon music can be made to include local radio stations. During instances where Alexa fails to respond to the voice input, an alternative voice-to-text facility can be adopted to complete the search.


## PhonePe

 As the name suggests, it is a payment app that works on UPI (User Payment Interface); facilitated by the Reserve Bank of India. It transacts the funds instantly between two bank accounts by storing user’s bank and card information and identifies the user uniquely within the server using a **BHIM UPI ID**. This ID serves as a username and a passcode is set to let the customer complete a transaction. The user should provide the mobile number associated with the bank account to create an account in PhonePe. Upon receiving confirmation from the user, it acquires approval from the bank to confirm the account number and the mobile number associated with it. This allows the customer to perform the fast and reliable transaction. Additionally, the application has a two-way security that enforces the customer to save two national identities (PAN and Aadhar) which stands as a unique identifier.
 
Unlike other UPI applications, PhonePe allows the user to navigate and traverse between multiple accounts from multiple banks. The UI comes handy with the ability to set remainders and execute **pre-authorised payments** ranging from Telephone, Broadband, Electricity, Municipal Tax, Gas, Credit Card and so on. This helps the user to access everything in one place. To add to it, it also uses GPS to track the location and provide commute facilities operated by local service providers. While paying monthly bills or a store cheque, it has a unique feature that allows the user to split the bill between multiple payers. The bill is equally divided: which notifies and reminds all the payers involved in the payment.

The application includes **QR code scanning** and **POS** payment method which is a lot safer as it prevents from the chance of theft and fraudulent purchases that uses your payment information. The POS payment option uses **Bluetooth** to connect to the merchant’s system. The payment initiation happens from the merchant’s site. The payer will be notified with the merchant’s identity and the amount of purchase which can then be completed by the payer by authorising the transaction using the touch ID or a passcode. Furthermore, it grants reward points for the transactions made using PhonePe which acts a complement that can be added to your mobile wallet.

The money in your PhonePe wallet can anytime be reverted to your bank account by a single swipe. You can also purchase gift cards, add money to your wallet that can be used up on paying your online and store bills. However, the application is specific to the local and national banks. It does not include or allow transfer for currencies other than Indian Rupee. PhonePe does not provide any additional authentication apart from the UPI Pin. An additional password should be enabled for every log in made by the user to provide improved security. This will help prevent hacking of your PhonePe account when your UPI Passcode is at risk.
